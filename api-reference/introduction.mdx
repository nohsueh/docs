## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an `x-api-key` header with the contents of the header being your [API Key](https://searchlysis.com/key). All API endpoints are authenticated using Api Keys and picked up from the specification file.

```json API Key
{
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "sk_123456789"
  }
}
```
